# One-Day Projects Playground

Welcome to the **One-Day Projects Playground** — my collection of quick hacks, nostalgic throwbacks, and “can I build this in a day?” experiments.  

This is less of a repo and more of a **theme park of code**.  
Every ride (a.k.a project) is different, some are silly, some are useful, all are fun.
